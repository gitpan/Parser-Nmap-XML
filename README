Parser/Nmap/XML version 0.5
============================

Parse Nmap xml-output files using perl

This module is intended to sift through the nmap scan outputs in xml form,
either by passing a filehandle that is being piped from a current nmap scan
or passing an xml filename that is the output of the of using the '-oX file.xml'
option. It uses the XML::Twig library, which is memory efficient and fast.
In the authors opinion, this module is very easy to use to extract information
from an nmap xml scan output about the scan itself and the hosts that were
scanned.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	XML::Twig 3.0+

In addition, you will need nmap 3.00+. You don't exactly need it, but this
version of nmap supports the xml output that this module can parse. So, you do
not really need the executable, but the xml output that you will be parsing
(or able to parse), must be from this version forward.
